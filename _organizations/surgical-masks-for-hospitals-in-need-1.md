name: Surgical Masks for Hospitals in Need
description: This campaign’s focus is to function as a “gap filler” for
  hospitals in dire need of PPE while they wait for large orders to arrive. It
  purchases small batches (400-800 pieces) of both surgical and KN95 masks, and
  ships directly to hospitals via Fed Ex International Priority. Supplies
  shipped in small batches are not held up in customs and reach their
  destination in 5 to 6 days.
