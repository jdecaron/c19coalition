description: CoProcure is a venture-backed technology startup on a mission to
  make local public purchasing more transparent, efficient, and inclusive. Their
  free search tool helps government buyers compliantly purchase from contracts
  that other governments have created. Competitively bid contracts on their
  platform can be reused by government buyers, saving government employees time,
  taxpayers money, and reducing the cost of selling to governments for
  suppliers. CoProcure is supporting local governments on COVID-19 response. On
  their COVID-19 resource page, they're tracking inventory of PPE and other
  items from verified suppliers and providing hands-on support to local govs in
  tracking down and group purchasing PPE items.
