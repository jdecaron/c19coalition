description: CoProcure is a venture-backed technology startup on a mission to
  make local public purchasing more transparent, efficient, and inclusive. Their
  free search tool helps government buyers compliantly purchase from contracts
  that other governments have created. Competitively bid contracts on their
  platform can be reused by government buyers, saving government employees time,
  taxpayers money, and reducing the cost of selling to governments for
  suppliers. To support local governments on COVID-19 response, CoProcure has
  published a COVID-19 resource page that tracks verified suppliers (i.e.
  suppliers who are eligible to sell PPE already through a cooperative contract
  and suppliers that have provided buyer reference(s) confirmed by their team.
  CoProcure is also providing hands-on support to local governments in tracking
  down PPE items. To date, they have indirectly served hundreds of users across
  all 50 states, and directly connected more than three dozen local governments
  to PPE and COVID-19 related response items.
