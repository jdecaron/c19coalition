description: A certified B-Corp and leading social impact company with a mission
  to help purpose-driven leaders take their impact to the next level,
  NationSwell has been convening leaders and organizations at the forefront of
  the pandemic to share best practices and mobilize action. Through the
  NationSwell Council, a membership community of 1000+ influential cross-sector
  impact leaders, and their broader ecosystem, NationSwell has been supporting
  some of the country's most prominent brands and philanthropies in their
  initial response efforts and long-term recovery. NationSwell has been
  elevating opportunities from the C-19 Coalition and serving as a funnel for
  companies and philanthropies to leverage their own assets for PPE procurement
  and support. As COVID-19 revealed the fragility of our social systems and
  structures, NationSwell is embarking on a robust initiative called Build It
  Back Better, bringing together leaders across society to begin to reimagine,
  redesign, and rewire our systems to be more inclusive, equitable and
  resilient. Launching this summer, the initiative will focus on key issue areas
  from Economic Opportunity to Sustainability to Healthcare with racial equity
  at the center. As part of the C19 Coalition, NationSwell commits to elevating
  key opportunities, sourcing information, and curating connections with trusted
  partners.
