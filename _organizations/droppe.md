  Droppe is a global load balancing service that helps first-line employees to
  get access to critical supplies.


  From the start of the pandemic, Droppe has been distributing both medical and non-medical supplies internationally to countries, states, hospitals, and private companies. All U.S. contracts have been executed through Droppe Oy, which has delivered medical supplies to private and public organizations.


  Droppe was made possible by implementing and leveraging modern technology as a tool for helping organizations affected by the shortage of supplies. The core innovation is to load-balance supplies from areas that are recovering to the ones where the crisis is still ramping up. The company is being built in Los Angeles, and Helsinki to build a long-term service to support essential supply flows during market turbulence.
