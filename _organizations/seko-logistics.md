description: >-
  With over 120 branches in more than 40 countries, global supply and demand
  chain solutions & logistics provider, SEKO Logistics, supports companies and
  organizations by not only introducing them to producers of PPE products, but
  also managing the end-to-end supply chain - from pick-up to final mile
  delivery into medical centers or DCs. SEKO Logistics also provides free
  sourcing, customs compliance and other logistics consultancy for PPE for
  medical workers and other first responders. China remains a main sourcing
  country for PPE, and SEKO has an extensive network and expertise to assist in
  the region. As one of the world’s leading logistics service providers to
  MedTec supply chains, SEKO is closely monitoring the increased demand for
  ‘surge capacity’ to support urgent shipments of medical diagnostic, clinic and
  hospital equipment and supplies, which require a highly flexible and rapid
  response network.


  Supported by a 24/7 hotline, SEKO’s 60 branches across the U.S. are responding to urgent and flexible storage space needs in order to quickly deliver to hospitals, while the company’s own SEKO CARES initiative helps frontline healthcare heroes and has already purchased several hundred thousand masks, including N95 respirator and 3-ply ear-loop surgical and medical masks, for donations to hospitals across the U.S. Additionally, SEKO has acquired and donated disposable medical bio-protective suits, working in partnership with Project C.U.R.E. to determine the hospitals most in need of PPE donations, and using its extensive ground transportation network to expedite shipments to hospitals in New York, Louisiana, Texas, Illinois, Colorado and the Navajo Nation.
