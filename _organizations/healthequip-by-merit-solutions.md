  HealthEquip™ connects individuals and organizations who have PPE and other
  critical supplies that can be donated and used by hospitals treating patients
  with the coronavirus (Covid-19). The app tracks the donation, manages the
  shipping of the donated supplies through UPS, and ensures shipping is paid for
  by the receiving hospital. It matches donations with the hospitals in the area
  based solely on demand – not preferential treatment. It also ensures that the
  individual or organization graciously donating with receive a donation
  receipt. Anyone who wants to participate in the fight may donate whether by
  the box or truckload.


  The American Hospital Association (AHA) with the 100 Million Mask initiative, Microsoft, Kaiser Permanente, Kearney and Merit Solutions have worked in partnership to accelerate the donation to hospital process. The result is a smart application, HealthEquip™ by Merit Solutions.
