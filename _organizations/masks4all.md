description: \#Masks4All is a 501c(3) non-profit project that works with a
  volunteer group of scientists to establish and communicate evidence on the
  efficacy of community mask wearing to slow the spread of COVID-19.
  Masks4All.co was involved with the first and largest evidence review of
  community mask wearing, and helped organize a letter to all U.S. governors
  from over 100 prominent scientists urging mask requirements in all U.S.
  states. Masks4All is committed to continuing to collate and share the best
  available scientific evidence, and to communicating it to decision makers and
  the public as effectively as possible.
