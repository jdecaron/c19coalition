description: Kaas Tailored is a furniture and aerospace manufacturing facility
  in Mukilteo, Washington, that has retooled their factory and created Kaas
  Health to help with the PPE shortage in the U.S. In March, Kass Tailored
  partnered with Providence St. Joseph’s Health and Services to design face
  masks and face shields to supply their 51 hospitals across five states at the
  onset of the pandemic and to support the relief efforts. They are committed to
  ‘loving their neighbor’ and helping in any way possible. Within a few short
  days, Kaas open-sourced their designs to the public and shared the specs on
  their website. Their factory is still manufacturing PPE for the healthcare
  community, as well as the general public. Going forward, Kaas is committed to
  supporting the needs of the American people and welcomes the opportunity to
  partner with hospitals, distributors, OEMs, or other manufacturers to lend
  it’s manufacturing capabilities and capacity to support those needs.
