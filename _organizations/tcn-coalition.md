description: "Founded in April 2020, the TCN Coalition is a global community of
  technologists united by the mission to support exposure notification apps
  during the COVID-19 pandemic. The TCN Coalition believes that exposure
  notification apps must be interoperable, trusted by the public, and
  privacy-preserving to quickly and safely reduce the need for lockdowns. They
  achieve this mission through several efforts: connecting and educating app
  developers about navigating the public health environment, assisting public
  health agencies in understanding how to deploy this technology safely and
  effectively, and supporting exposure notification apps with open source
  software."
