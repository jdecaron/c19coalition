description: The TCN Coalition is a global community of technologists united by
  the mission to support exposure notification apps during the COVID-19
  pandemic. The TCN Coalition believes that exposure notification apps must be
  interoperable, trusted by the public, and privacy-preserving to quickly and
  safely reduce the need for lockdowns. Theyâ€™re connecting and educating app
  developers about navigating the public health environment, assisting public
  health agencies in understanding how to deploy this technology safely and
  effectively, and supporting exposure notification apps with open source
  software.
