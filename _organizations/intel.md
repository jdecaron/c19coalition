description: In Governor Newsom’s COVID-19 press conference on June 26, 2020, he
  announced the Safely Making California Marketplace partnership with the
  California Manufacturers and Technology Association to connect California
  manufacturers to employers to acquire PPE. With the help of the C19 Coalition,
  the governor’s office approached Intel to provide technical expertise to
  create the marketplace framework and to design and direct the marketplace
  project. In response to this request, Intel Foundation launched its first
  Intel Employee Service Corps (IESC) skill-based Externship program to manage
  and provide technical support to this critical effort in partnership with the
  State of California and CMTA. Intel Foundation is supporting the partnership
  by lending time and talent of two full-time employees with engineering and
  manufacturing expertise to lead the overall project management as it grows and
  becomes even more functional.
