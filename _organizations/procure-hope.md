description: ProCure Hope is a small team of professionals spanning the US and
  Asia who are volunteering their time to identify, source, transport and donate
  badly needed PPE to front-line and essential workers. With representatives on
  the ground in both China and the US who speak both English and Mandarin, they
  are able to evaluate the efficacy of the supply chains and dramatically
  shorten the time to get masks into the hands of those most in need.
