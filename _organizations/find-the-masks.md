name: Find the Masks
description: Find the Masks is a US-focused PPE needs mapping tool with 4000
  healthcare facilities with depleted supply and in need of PPE. Their mission
  is to enable private citizens, communities, makerspace networks, and
  large-scale manufacturers to engage and assist during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  Their website includes level 1 trauma centers across our country but also
  features a broader scope of where the frontline workers are by listing
  community healthcare clinics, long-term care facilities, blood banks,
  shelters, and more. Finding a place to provide PPE is interactive and requests
  to join the map are honored within minutes to hours through their dedicated
  data team.
