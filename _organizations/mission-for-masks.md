name: Mission for Masks
description: Mission for Masks is an initiative from Jess Jacobs and Sonja
  Schwartzbach, BSN, RN, CCRN and sponsored by the New World Foundation which
  has moved tens of thousands of medical-grade mask donations and smaller
  donations of other PPE to hospital workers and essential workers across the
  country through relationships with domestic importers, domestic manufacturers
  and philanthropists. M4M commits to expanding its constituencies to include
  non-essential workers and civilians to ensure that all people are justly
  protected against the COVID-19 virus as the nation navigates reopening.
