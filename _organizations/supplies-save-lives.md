name: Supplies Save Lives
description: Suppiles Save Lives is a group of volunteers who have set up a text
  number to collect donations from citizens, businesses and other places that
  may have a surplus of N95 masks, surgical masks, isolation gowns, gloves and
  wipes to reduce the barriers around safely donating unused supplies. They
  provide a Zero Contact pick up and deliver to frontline medical providers in
  local areas with the most urgent needs. They are partnering with GetUsPPE and
  OnFleet nationally.
