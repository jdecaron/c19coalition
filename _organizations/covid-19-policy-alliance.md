name: COVID-19 Policy Alliance
description: The COVID-19 Policy Alliance, led by MIT faculty, is creating
  data-driven tools to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on high-risk
  populations such as the staff and residents of long-term care facilities. In
  partnership with the Massachusetts Senior Care Association (MSCA) and a group
  of associations in New Hampshire, the team is shipping more than $2 million
  worth of PPE materials. The team has launched a surveillance testing program
  in partnership with the MSCA that is delivering 500 tests to two long-term
  care facilities. They have also informed Massachusetts state policymakers on
  guidance related to the testing of residents and staff in long-term
  facilities. The analytics team has developed predictive tools that are
  providing Massachusetts policymakers with operational recommendations to
  balance the load across hospital systems in the state. The Alliance leadership
  commits to share data from all its initiatives with C19 Coalition members,
  policymakers and their advisors.
