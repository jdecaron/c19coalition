description: "One PPE Sourceâ€™s mission is simple: to provide high-quality
  personal protective equipment to professionals and individuals. Leveraging 20+
  years of experience in importing and distributing products from Asia, they
  lean on trusted and long-standing local supply partners in China, Vietnam,
  Malaysia, Korea and Thailand to source and vet local production facilities,
  product and capacity. Their local partners help manage and oversee every step
  of the export process to ensure the complete and accurate shipment of the
  specified goods. Through these relationships, One PPE Source has been able to
  access some of the top PPE brand manufacturers and secure significant
  capacity. Additionally, with over 30 years of experience in financial
  services, One PPE Source is helping to facilitate financing of PPE, working to
  bridge the gap between buyer and seller logistics, including financing if
  needed."
