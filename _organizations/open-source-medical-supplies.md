description: OSMS (Open Source Medical Supplies) is building a repository of
  transparent, accurate, layman-accessible, medically-reviewed requirements for
  medical supply designs, then providing open-source designs for supplies that
  meet those requirements. Their goal is to help local manufacturers and makers
  provide vetted supplies directly to their hospitals, and later to help create
  local fabrication networks across the globe to respond to hospital needs.
