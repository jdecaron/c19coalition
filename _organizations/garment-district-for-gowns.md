name: Garment District for Gowns
description: Garment District for Gowns (GDFG) is a NYC-based non-profit
  organization, locally manufacturing reusable medical gowns for hospital and
  healthcare organizations in urgent need. GDFG is made up of fashion designers,
  product developers, pattern makers, and sewers with over a decade of
  experience working for major brands. As funding allows, they are hiring
  Garment District factories for production. Upon manufacturing completion,
  gowns undergo a gamma irradiation process as an added safety measure at
  Steris. Gowns are then delivered to hospitals and medical centers in the
  Tri-State area. GDFG is supported by local government, corporate sponsors, and
  individuals.
