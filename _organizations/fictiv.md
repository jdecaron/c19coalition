description: "**Fictiv**is a cloud based network of over 200 manufacturing
  plants in the U.S. and abroad that get routed designs and orders for parts
  from customers on the platform. In response to COVID-19, Fictiv has invested
  in the upfront tooling costs to produce face shields and make them available
  as quickly and easily as possible to healthcare agencies, service providers,
  distributors, and even non-healthcare original equipment manufacturers that
  are pivoting to support the healthcare industry during this crisis. It has
  matched pricing to cost, and profits beyond initial tooling and unit
  manufacturing costs will be donated to the COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund
  for the World Health Organization."
