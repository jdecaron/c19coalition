description: Fictiv is a cloud based network of over 200 manufacturing plants in
  the U.S. and abroad that get routed designs and orders for parts from
  customers on the platform. In response to COVID-19, Fictiv has invested in the
  upfront tooling costs to produce face shields and make them available as
  quickly and easily as possible to healthcare agencies, service providers,
  distributors, and non-healthcare original equipment manufacturers that are
  pivoting to support the healthcare industry. Profits beyond initial tooling
  and unit manufacturing costs will be donated to the COVID-19 Solidarity
  Response Fund for the World Health Organization.
