description: One Mask has created a opensource mask design conceived for mass
  production by companies with automated cutting and seaming technologies, such
  as producers of sneakers, outdoor and athletic gear, furniture, window
  coverings, clothing and packaging. It uses a non-woven fabric that does not
  require stitching to prevent fraying and is extremely effective blocking
  particles from passing through it.
