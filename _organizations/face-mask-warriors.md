name: Face Mask Warriors
description: Face Mask Warriors is a collaboration of over 16,000+ volunteers
  across the United States. Theyâ€™re using skills including sewing, technology,
  organizing, and more to help protect as many people across the country as
  possible. Their goal is connecting those in need with those who can provide,
  no matter how much or how little. Their focus is handmade face masks, but they
  are also creating handmade gowns, scrub caps, headbands, and shoe covers.
