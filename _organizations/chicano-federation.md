  Chicano Federation has a legacy of tackling critical social issues and
  ensuring our communities have a voice in the policies that impact their lives.
  Since day one of the COVID-19 health crisis, we have worked tirelessly to meet
  the emerging needs of children, families, tenants, childcare providers, and
  essential workers throughout San Diego County.\

  \

  In San Diego County, Latinos make up approximately 65% of the positive cases in the region despite being only 30% of the population. We continue to be a trusted resource for the community and a safe place for people to turn to for answers and resources. Due to the apparent lack of testing and contact tracing amongst these communities, Chicano Federation has now partnered with research institutions to study the perceptions and barriers of testing among the Latino community in San Diego County and now hosting various COVID-19 free testing sites.\

  \

  Through a community-centered approach that guides our work, we have identified the need for COVID-19 prevention and supplies. To keep our community safe and healthy, we will be providing kits that include reusable and disposable face masks, hand sanitizer, children's face masks, thermometers, disinfectant supplies, and much more.With the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionally affecting communities of color, we will continue to provide these much-needed supplies to keep everyone safe and healthy. The need for these supplies is unprecedented and urgent.
