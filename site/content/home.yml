intro: >-
  National PPE Coalition brings crucial partners together to help build an
  efficient, unified supply chain for PPE and lifesaving medical devices. State
  governments, corporations, manufacturers, non-profits, and individuals can
  connect through us to share and request resources and information.


  Our members are working on every part of the problem: supply, demand, fulfillment, logistics, funding, and information tracking. We use real-time updates about what every organization is doing in order to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.


  By coordinating all emergency PPE crisis efforts, we help minimize the risk of misdirecting critical supplies to places that may need them less urgently, and increase their individual power exponentially. We’re working together to ensure that every shipment of PPE sent is a life-saving shipment.

  - title: Connecting need to supply
    description: As hospitals struggle to find safe and reliable equipment, several
      organizations have come together to shake up the supply chain, improve
      logistics, and help save lives. Several coalition members are acting as
      clearinghouses for medical equipment by matching buyers to suppliers,
      tracking urgent needs and helping with logistics to ensure that PPE gets
      to where it is needed most. They’ve taken in thousands of institutional
      requests so far and started making matches with suppliers.

      - title: Project N95
        description: Project N95 is focused on delivering medical equipment into the
          hands of healthcare providers as quickly as possibly by serving as the
          nation's medical clearinghouse for hospital and healthcare requests
          and suppliers who are able to provide medical equipment, including
          ventilators. They’re working with FEMA, governments, and hospitals and
          healthcare networks to determine where demand is and where it is most
          urgent.
