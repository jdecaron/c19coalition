The new, uncharted territory of COVID-19 holds to be the challenge for public health officials, researchers, and policymakers alike. With new developments and various forecasts for the future, adaptability and flexibility have been the gold star for many individuals to focus on their intended mission and goals.

This holds true for volunteer, Mary Robertson, who joined the C19 Coalition at the beginning of April. Through her Ph.D. research in Anthropology, Robertson studied the diversification of advertising in South Africa and how to mend issues of representation. After graduating, she moved into research to design tech experiences that seek to benefit others.

Through various user experience (UX) and design research, she continues to gain knowledge in what motivates individuals, solving problems, and learning new concepts.

From volunteering with the help desk to conducting communication analysis, Robertson continues to impact the mission of the organization. Through professional experience, Robertson has used her skill set to determine C19 Coalition’s outreach through the help desk and beyond.

> “I want to share the experiences of people who are on the front lines, people who are on the ground, and people who have expressed and shared their concerns with us.”, said Roberston as she discussed her vision of the organization. 

Robertson continues to strategize how the organization will pursue such individuals to address their concerns and lessen disparities with COVID-19.
