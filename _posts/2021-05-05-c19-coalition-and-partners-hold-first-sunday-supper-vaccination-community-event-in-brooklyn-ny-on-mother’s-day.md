[The C19 Coalition](https://c19coalition.org/) and its partners [Stop the Spread](https://www.stopthespread.org/) and [Project N95](https://www.projectn95.org/) are working in collaboration with the [Church of God of East New York ](https://cog-eny.com/)and the [Community Healthcare Network (CHN)](https://www.chnnyc.org/) to host its first of a series of Sunday Suppers this Mother’s Day, May 9th, 2021 in Brooklyn, New York.

***The event, which will run from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at the Church of God of East New York, at 905 Sutter Avenue. It will be an opportunity to get vaccinated while connecting with the community. The entrance is on Warwick St.***

The event will have Pfizer first and second doses available for anyone on a walk-up basis. Additionally, upon vaccination, a supply of masks and a free to-go meal supplied by a local restaurant will be provided.

This and future Sunday Suppers is made possible by a fundraiser the C19 Coalition held with [Shots for Shots](https://www.shotsforshots.org/) in April that raised nearly $100,000 using [NFT’s NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic by bringing PPE and vaccination particularly to communities of color. Additional support was provided by Project N95.

“It was a thrill to help the C19 Coalition bring the Shots for Shots fundraiser to life,” said Ian Schafer, an advisor to Shots for Shots. “The enthusiasm of the incredible NBA Top Shot community and its leaders provided the energy for this effort, and is proof of what (and how quickly) greatness can happen when people choose to become force multipliers for good.”

The C19 Coalition is a non-profit, cross-sector group of organizations, companies, states, and philanthropists that has delivered more than a billion units of PPE since March 2020.

“I'm so proud of the incredible team and partners that have come together to help make the first Sunday Supper on this coming Mother's Day,” said Laura Mignott, the Sunday Supper project lead for C19 Coalition. “The goal of this event is to bring community and dignity to the experience of getting vaccines, especially to communities of color.”

The sites themselves were co-designed by CHN and Stop the Spread with the purpose of offering vaccines in a trusted space that’s part of the fabric of the community. The hope is the event will draw those who still need to be vaccinated by offering vaccines in a community event.

Also, [Dr Brittany Richards](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/faculty/BRichards), assistant professor from the [Nursing Department at CUNY New York City College of Technology](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/nursing/)  and Board Member and Health Policy Chair of the [Greater NYC Black Nurses Association](https://gnycbna.org/), will be available during the event to answer questions about the vaccine. 

"Stop the Spread is excited to bring together our national and local partners like the C19 Coalition and Community Healthcare Network to address vaccine equity in communities that have been especially hard hit by the pandemic,” said Sharon Knight, executive director of Stop the Spread. “We hope this partnership brings new ideas and promising practices to increase vaccine uptake and build vaccine confidence, while giving back to the community."

The vaccine site is one of four community-based vaccine clinics being run by CHN, a Federally Qualified Health Center.

"Community Healthcare Network is committed to bringing vaccines to our neighborhoods working with our community partners,” said Robert Hayes, president and CEO of the Community Healthcare Network. “This event shows the power of the community in East New York. Together, we can create welcoming spaces for residents to learn about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine and then get a free shot."

The masks at the event are delivered by Project N95, a rapid response organization that has been a trusted resource for vetted personal protective equipment throughout the pandemic, delivering more than 6.3 million units of PPE nationwide since May 2020.

"Since the earliest days of the pandemic, our nonprofit organization has been committed to opening access to the resources people need to stay safe," said Marilyn Levi-Baumgarten, director of partnerships for Project N95. "Working with trusted partners like the C19 Coalition allows us to extend our reach even further into communities where COVID-19 has had a disproportionate impact to help get them the protection they need."

The Church of God of East New York is considered a neighborhood church of different cultures and communities.

"The Church of God of East New York has a deep and long history with our community, serving and helping all people, whether they need a place to worship or a comfortable and trusted space to receive their COVID-19 vaccine,” said Reverend Clifton McDowell. “We are honored to host this event to celebrate Mother's Day and give people access to vaccines to protect themselves and their loved ones."

The Church of God of East New York Vaccine Site is open every Wednesday and Thursday  from 5:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m to 5:30 p.m.
