summary: C19 Coalition helps to promote the Chicano Federation and help them
  reach their fundraising goal to be able to provide PPE to the city of San
  Diego

A growing need for PPE in San Diego, California has caused the non-profit organization, The Chicano Federation, to rise up and try to meet those needs. Latinx’s in San Diego accounts for 65% of the total positive cases in the entire county, which has increased the need for PPE in these communities where people of color are most affected. These communities are having emerging needs as this pandemic continues. This encompasses PPE, as well as affordable housing, child care, help with utility bills, as well as rental assistance.



The Chicano Federation has been tirelessly working to get PPE out to the community, as well as help with all the emerging needs that have come from this pandemic. They are dedicated to helping their community, so they held a PPE drive, where 400 PPE kits were handed out. In these kits, there were children and adult masks, hand sanitizer, and thermometers, to name a few. These kits were gone within 30 minutes of the start of the distribution. The impact of The Chicano Federation can be seen from San Diego as well as Orange County. They are able to help provide services that impact not only the Latinx community, but all communities where people of color are disproportionately affected. They were named non-profit of the year for their work in the community. Fellow San Diego native, Jess Jacobs, founder of Mission for Masks was able to donate 600 units of PPE to their organization.



Chief Operating Officer and President of the Chicano Federation, Nancy Maldonado, said that, “The COVID-19 health crisis largely impacted San Diego’s Latino community. Chicano Federation has a legacy of tackling important social issues and ensuring our communities have a voice in the policies that impact their lives. Since day one of the COVID-19 health crisis, we have worked tirelessly to meet the emerging needs of children, families, tenants, childcare providers and essential workers across San Diego County. Chicano Federation continues to combat the systemic inequities that continue to impact our communities by advocating for and providing resources, information, and data driven research”.



The impact that the Chicano Federation has had on their community has gotten the attention of local Chula Vista Mayor, Mary Casillas Salas, who said, “The Chicano Federation is an organization that has impacted the lives of thousands in our communities by providing high quality critical services to those in need. Additionally, the Chicano Federation has embraced the entrepreneurial spirit of our communities by helping hundreds of women become small business owners and increasing access to child care”.



The Chicano Federation has been helping their community in any way that surfaces during this pandemic, and currently has a growing need for PPE. They are seeking donations to help their community. They are currently running a fundraiser, that is until the end of October, where they are trying to raise $50,000 in donations. These donations go straight to helping with the distribution kits that are helping keep the Latinx community healthy. They are currently at 61% to their goal, and with our help we can help them get to their goal. All tax-deductible donations can be made through their website <https://bit.ly/3lbL2os> .



Ashley Gazich, of C19 Coalition, has worked closely with the Chicano Federation, and helped them get PPE. On working for the organization, she has said that, “The Chicano Federation is a leader in supporting communities in Southern California. From COVID-19 response to economic opportunity to civic engagement, they have built innovative solutions to address critical needs. Their programs are founded on respect and empathy for the communities they serve, and it is an honor to learn from and collaborate with their team. What the Chicano Federation is doing is truly special, and I believe the frameworks they have in place are an example to organizations across the nation looking to scale their impact”.



C19 Coalitions partners have already stepped up to help with their increasing need for PPE. These donations are helping to further the Chicano Federation’s mission to help protect the Latinx community in San Diego. The organization has also been a part of C19’s Adopt-A-School program, which was started to help give schools access to the PPE they need in order to stay healthy when the schools reopen. Corina Estevez, of C19 Coalition, along with Ashley have started the Adopt-A-School program, and said that, “As children and teachers return to school, we need to do all that we can to make sure they are safe from being infected by the Covid-19 virus. C19 Coalitions Adopt-A-School program is providing PPE to schools in need, with a focus on those in low-income communities.”



The work the Chicano Federation is doing in their community is impactful because they are not only providing PPE, but are also providing any help that is needed during this pandemic. They have been an integral part in leading the newly formed San Diego Latino Health Coalition, whose primary goal is reducing Covid-19 infection rates, increasing access to vital information, increasing participation in Covid-19 testing and contact tracing, and most importantly, saving lives.



The C19 Coalition is proud to be a part of helping The Chicano Federation spread the word on getting valuable resources donated to them. Below there are
