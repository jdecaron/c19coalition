  Diego

The [C19 Coalition](c19coalition.org) is proud to recognize the work of the non-profit organization the [Chicano Federation](www.chicanofederation.org/) and what it has done to help meet the needs of Latinx's in San Diego County.

With about 65 percent of the total positive cases in San Diego County being Latinx, the Chicano Federation targeted this group with emerging needs as the pandemic continues and has worked tirelessly to get PPE out to the community. Already it has handed out PPE kits to help more than 400 people. In these kits, there were children and adult masks, hand sanitizer, and thermometers, to name a few. The demand was so fierce that in just 30 minutes the kits were gone.

But the Chicano Federation has no plans to slow down finding supply for both San Diego and Orange County where it has branched out to as well.  It is able to help provide services that impact not only the Latinx community, but all areas where people of color are disproportionately affected. They were named non-profit of the year for their work in the community.

"The Covid-19 health crisis has a legacy of tackling important social issues and ensuring our communities have a voice in the policies that impact their lives," said Nancy Maldonado, president of the Chicano Federation and Chief Operating Officer. "Since day one of the COVID-19 health crisis, we have worked tirelessly to meet the emerging needs of children, families, tenants, childcare providers and essential workers across San Diego County."

Maldonado said the Chicano Federation also provides resources, information, and data driven research to combat the system inequities.

The impact that the Chicano Federation has had on their community has gotten the attention of local Chula Vista Mayor, Mary Casillas Salas, who said, “The Chicano Federation is an organization that has impacted the lives of thousands in our communities by providing high quality critical services to those in need. Additionally, the Chicano Federation has embraced the entrepreneurial spirit of our communities by helping hundreds of women become small business owners and increasing access to child care”.

The Chicano Federation has been helping its community in any way that surfaces during this pandemic, and currently has a growing need for PPE. It is seeking donations to help its community and is currently running a fundraiser until the end of October. The goal is to try and raise $50,000 in donations. These donations go straight to helping with the distribution kits that are helping keep the Latinx community healthy. The Chicano Foundation is at  61 percent of its goal.  All tax-deductible donations can be made through their website <https://bit.ly/3lbL2os>.

The C19 Coalition has worked closely with the Chicano Federation, and helped them get PPE. C19 Coalition's affiliate partner Mission for Masks donated face shields and kn95s that helped close to 600 people. It also connected the Chicano Federation with Social Collective Health which donated 200 thermometers. Ashley Gazich, a project lead with C19 Coalition says the support the Chicano Federation has given to communities in Southern California areas is impressive because its programs are founded on respect and empathy for the communities it serves. Also its innovative solutions to address critical needs is exemplary.

"What the Chicano Federation is doing is truly special, and I believe the frameworks they have in place is an example to organizations across the nation looking to scale their impact," Gazich said.

Besides working with organizations such as the Chicano Federation, the C19 Coalition's partners have delivered more than 400 million units of PPE around the country since March primarily to frontline workers, educators, students and communities.

Additionally the C19 Coalition has created a program called Adopt A School to help serve underfunded school districts, educators and students in need of PPE.

“As children and teachers return to school, we need to do all that we can to make sure they are safe from being infected by the Covid-19 virus," said Corina Estevez who leads the C19 Coalition's Adopt a school. "This program provides PPE to schools in need, with a focus on those in low-income communities."

The C19 Coalition is also focused on colleges serving Black (HBCU), Latinx (HSI) and Indigenous (TCU) student populations that are in urgent need of PPE, testing, and support. The C19 Coalition is developing “Sunday Suppers” and other programs to serve them.

Finally, C19 Coalition is also looking to help deliver PPE to underserved sectors such as small businesses, farmers, and private medical practices.
