The C19 Coalition would like to wish the President, First Lady, White House staff, and the thousands of people inflicted every day with Covid-19 a swift and full recovery.

Overnight, the [C19 Coalition](c19coalition.org) has seen a considerable spike in visits to its Website and social channels. The C19 Coalition hopes this is an opportunity to reemphasize this pandemic is serious and respects no one. Because of this, it’s important to continue to protect ourselves and others from Covid’s threat through social distancing, the use of masks and other PPE. It’s also important to educate oneself of this virus through credible sources. The C19 Coalition considers the [Center for Disease Control (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html), the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019), and [Covid-19 Facts](https://www.covid-19facts.com/) to be reliable.

The C19 Coalition and its partners have delivered more than 400 million units of PPE since March primarily to frontline workers, educators, students and communities. While an impact has been made, there’s still a long way to go, especially in disproportionately impacted communities around the country.

To start, the C19 Coalition has created a program called Adopt A School to help serve underfunded school districts, educators and students in need of PPE.

Also, the C19 Coalition is looking to help deliver PPE to underserved sectors such as small businesses, farmers, and private medical practices.

This Country is facing historical challenges right now. The C19 Coalition feels that now is the time for everyone to step up and do its part to get through this.
