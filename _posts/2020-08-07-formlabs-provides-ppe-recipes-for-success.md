summary: As one of the earliest partners of the C-19 Coalition, 3D printer
  manufacturer Formlabs has led the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic by
  providing designs that any one that owns the printers can print out on their
  own.

Sometimes the fishing pole is more important than the fish itself.

In the fight against COVID-19, a 3D printer can be just as vital as the PPE and medical devices it creates.

[Formlabs](formlabs.com) has proved this well.

Headquartered in Sommerville, Mass., the developer and manufacturer of 3D printers has a network of innovators to come up with a number of "recipes" that can be used on its more than 70,000 3D units.

"If you need a custom face mask fitter or nasal swabs, we can provide the instructions that the printers in homes, dental labs, and health care facilities can print out on the devices they already have," said Diana Verdugo, Partnership and Community Lead for Formlabs. "By sharing these, we hope ultimately lives can be saved."

Officially the 3D printer has been around since the 1980s, but has recently seen a rise in popularity as prices have come down and design software has improved. The devices work by printing objects layer-by-layer before being rinsed by a solvent and hardened with ultraviolet light. Typically the printers have been used for making jewelry, dental parts, or prototype designs for engineers and inventors.\

In March, Formlabs teamed up with the University of South Florida (USF) Health and Northwell Health, New York's largest healthcare provider, to provide 3D printed nasal swabs which were used by hospitals and healthcare teams as testing increased. Northwell Health now is able to print as many as 3,000 swabs a day if needed.

"The speed and scale at which these swabs were designed, 3D printed, tested, and put into clinical use around the world represents a great example of the incredible impact that can be achieved when teams of experts across academia, healthcare, and the tech industry come together with a common purpose," said Guarav Manchanda, Healthcare Director of Formlabs.

At Yale, Dr. Luiz  Maracaja designed a framed face shield that can be connected to any compressed air. He printed it on his FormLab printer at home, and has since provided several hundred of these masks. 

For anyone with a 3D printer, Formlabs has created [a community library](https://formlabs.com/covid-19-response/community-part-library/) of "impactful solutions" that any one are ready to print. These items include Maracaja's creation as well as face mask fitters and contactless door openers.

Instead of seeking profits, Maracaja hopes others follow suit and help anyway they can for the better good.

"I really hope that mankind can get back to normal," said Dr. Luiz Maracaja, [in a story that aired on Fox61 in Connecticut](https://www.fox61.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/yale-medicine-doctor-creating-face-shields-for-colleagues/520-c2101951-dbc9-4547-ac67-802ebe113475). "I donâ€™t want any money out of this."

As a partner of the C19 Coalition, Formlabs was one of the earliest companies to respond to the COVID-19 crisis.

"They have played an important role not only in responding to the needs of those impacted by the crisis, but also by empowering other companies to play critical roles through their open design process," said Joe Wilson, co-founder of the C19 Coalition. "We are proud to have them as a partner."

Presently Formlabs is seeking underserved and women communities who could benefit from 3D printing and education needs.
