As quarantine has switched up everyone’s routines, the word ‘pivot’ has been used to demonstrate the ‘new normal’ to adapt to these changes. For some, that means to be more active, indulge in hobbies that were overlooked, and reach out for new endeavors.

These ‘pivots’ are dire as we get into the next phases of reopening and increasing cases in some areas of the United States. For C19 Coalition volunteer, Kelli Cree, volunteering has been her constant. As a serial volunteer, Cree has been involved in a number of children related nonprofit boards prior to COVID19. As a mother of three, she saw gaps that needed to be filled in her community’s school system. She initially started volunteering with her children’s schools. This later turned into involvement with different levels of PTA, foundations, school district forums, and other education boards.

When schools started to shut down due to COVID19, many community-based events were also postponed or canceled. For Cree, this meant that many of her volunteer work had to take the back-burner. Yet, this did not stop her from looking for opportunities to help her community. During the early stages of shelter in place, Cree came across many people who were creating masks. Although this was one way to help in the pandemic, Cree was approached by a college friend who was involved with the coalition.

Ever since, Cree has used her extra time to move the coalition’s mission by managing emails and updating the directory. The hotline is the coalition’s front for those interested in learning more about the organization and/or PPE requests. Cree’s work has been essential in keeping the coalition organized and streamlined.

There is more work to be done, however, volunteers like Cree have been fundamental to the coalition’s impact.

## Q&A with Kelli Cree

***Tell us about your background.***

I am from the Bay Area. I’ve worked a lot with children issues like working at a children's museum, especially in the art area to bring art to life. I’ve also worked in a think tank where I would bring software and hardware to people in the United States states. It’s also important for me to work for myself, so I also work as a website designer. Outside of my work-life, I have three children in middle and high school. IT was because of them that I got involved with nonprofit boards such as pre-schools, PTA, education foundations across the school district, and different levels of PTA to advocate for different issues.

***What made you interested in volunteering, in general?***

I saw gaps that needed to be filled. I wanted to help out and show that people can give back easily in their community. That’s why I started volunteering at the Elementary school and PTA. I really enjoy making things like knitting and art. I see my passion for this as an opportunity to bring art to students, rather that be an educational art program or bring together artists and students. Art has a place in education and that is what I want to convey.

***When you think about our mission, what motivates you to continue volunteering?***

Things really change when shelter in place happened and many things closed down. There was a lot of community- based events that couldn’t happen in the springtime, such as International Night. This was a night where people can speak about the county they come from. There were many other events that we lost. During COVID19, I did come across people who were interested in creating masks and clothes so I thought that could be an opportunity for me to volunteer for my community.

I was later approached by my friend about C19 Coalition and it seemed like a greater opportunity for me. When I think about our mission and my motivation, I think about my frustrations with the national crisis and how it is being addressed. The work being done at the coalition sees that and works towards positive change.
