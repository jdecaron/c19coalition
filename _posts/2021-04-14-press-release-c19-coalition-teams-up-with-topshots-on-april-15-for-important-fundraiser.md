The [C19 Coalition](https://deploy-preview-290--zealous-stonebraker-4c4acf.netlify.app/2021/04/14/c19coalition.org) is proud to announce a partnership with NBA Top Shots to create one of the first NFT fundraisers, [Shots for Shots](https://deploy-preview-290--zealous-stonebraker-4c4acf.netlify.app/2021/04/14/www.shotsforshots.org), using NBA Top Shot to help fight the Covid-19 pandemic by bringing PPE, testing and vaccination to communities of color at HBCU campuses, churches,  and community centers via its Sunday Suppers program. 

The event will take place at 7 p.m. EST on the Twitch live stream of Warren Buckets (<https://www.twitch.tv/trillingham>). Guests that include [Josh Hart](https://twitter.com/joshhart) of the New Orleans Pelicans, [Michael Carter Williams](https://twitter.com/mcarterwilliams) of the Orando Magic, and [DJ Skee](https://twitter.com/djskee) will be opening limited edition packs provided by the team at [NBA Top Shot.](https://nbatopshot.com/)

"We're excited to work with NBA Top Shot, Warren Buckets, [Kindred](https://kindredmembers.com/) and more to utilize the awesome power of NFTs to make a meaningful immediate impact to these communities," said Laura Mignott, who runs the Sunday Suppers for the C19 Coalition.

The C19 Coalition is a non-profit, cross-sector group of organizations, companies, states, and philanthropists working to address PPE shortages across the country. Collectively it has delivered more than a billion units of PPE since March 2020 primarily to frontline workers, educators, students and communities. A large focus of the deliveries are to disproportionately impacted communities around the country.

"The NBA Top Shot community is full of passionate, caring, and wonderful people," said [Jacob Eisenberg](https://twitter.com/Eisenberg43), of NBA Top Shot. "It's amazing to see community initiatives like Shots for Shots sprout up organically with the help of the C19 Coalition, and I couldn't be prouder to join the athletes, influencers, moderators, and organizers who've come together to leverage Top Shot as a vehicle for positive change. I'm really excited to see the community rally around this amazing cause."
