"We're excited to work with NBA Top Shot,  [Kindred](https://kindredmembers.com/) and more to utilize the awesome power of NFTs to make a meaningful immediate impact to these communities," said [Laura Mignott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauramignott), who runs the Sunday Suppers for the C19 Coalition.

The C19 Coalition is a non-profit, cross-sector group of organizations, companies, states, and philanthropists working to address PPE shortages across the country. Collectively it has delivered more than a billion units of PPE since March 2020 primarily to frontline workers, educators, students and communities. A large focus of the deliveries are to disproportionately impacted communities around the country.
