  At Sista Afya Community Mental Wellness, we believe that together, Black women
  across the African Diaspora can sustain mental wellness through connecting to
  resources and supporting one another.


  We fulfill this through our mission of sustaining the mental wellness of Black women through building community, sharing information, and connecting Black women to quality mental wellness services. We believe that by making mental wellness simple, accessible, affordable, and centered around Black women's experiences, more people will get what they need to have a full, whole life.


  Sista Afya Community Mental Wellness has a community support approach to mental wellness. We believe that community support for people living with mental health conditions can foster healing, growth, freedom, and self-actualization.
