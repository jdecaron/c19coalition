  National PPE Coalition brings crucial partners together to help build an
  efficient, unified supply chain for PPE and lifesaving medical devices. State
  governments, corporations, manufacturers, non-profits, and individuals can
  connect through us to share and request resources and information.


  Our members are working on every part of the problem: supply, demand, fulfillment, logistics, funding, and information tracking. We use real-time updates about what every organization is doing in order to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.


  By coordinating all emergency PPE crisis efforts, we help minimize the risk of misdirecting critical supplies to places that may need them less urgently, and increase their individual power exponentially. Weâ€™re working together to ensure that every shipment of PPE sent is a life-saving shipment.
