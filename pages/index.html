          Leadership response to the urgent shortages of PPE:
        </p>
        <p>
          Many people across the nation are stepping up to solve the crisis that is afflicting our heroic frontline health workers. We are distributors and hospitals, manufacturers and doctors, teams matchmaking between hospitals and suppliers, 3D printers, grassroots efforts to find unused or novel sources of supply, and importers from global supply chains. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Our members are committed to leading the way out of the crisis. This site is designed to bring awareness to the efforts underway and to help donors, volunteers, policymakers and providers connect to the right initiative.

        <h3>Partners & Resources</h3>
        <h4>Non-Profit Matching</h4>
        <p>
          In the absence of clear ways for those in need of PPE to find legitimate and high quality PPE suppliers around the world, impressive grassroots matching organizations have taken the lead to architect trusted and effective marketplaces.

        </ul>
        <h4>New Supply Sourcing</h4>
        <p>
          As demand for PPE has surged, the typical supply chains have not been able to keep up. To fill the gap, new organizations have sprouted up in an attempt to find new supply sources.

        </ul>

        <h4>Philanthropies</h4>
        <p>
          Long-standing and trusted philanthropies have stepped up to help fight the spread of COVID-19 by assisting healthcare providers in their attempts to purchase key equipment that is in short-supply.

        <h4>Idea Intake</h4>
        <p>
          With things changing so fast every day, there’s certainly no shortage of a need for new socially-conscious innovation. There are some great new sites that ask us to put our minds together and submit ideas for a better future.

        </ul>

        <h4>Resources</h4>
        <p>
          It’s more important than ever to ensure that we are consuming and distributing factual information. There’s an endless amount of ill-informed tips out there, but there are also some amazing data-driven resources to learn about what’s going on.
