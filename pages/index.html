  <h2>C19 Coalition brings crucial partners together to help build an efficient,
  unified supply chain for PPE and lifesaving medical devices. State
  governments, corporations, manufacturers, non-profits, and individuals can
  connect through us to share and request resources and information.</h2>


  Our members are working on every part of the problem: supply, demand, fulfillment, logistics, funding, and information tracking. We use real-time updates about what every organization is doing in order to maximize efficiency and effectiveness.


  By coordinating all emergency PPE crisis efforts, we help minimize the risk of misdirecting critical supplies to places that may need them less urgently, and increase their individual power exponentially. We’re working together to ensure that every shipment of PPE sent is a life-saving shipment.


  Since March, Coalition Partners have manufactured and distributed more than 100 million net new units of PPE across the country. The Coalition is working collaboratively with the National Governors Association (NGA) and directly with states like New Jersey to acquire more information about the greatest needs and how to activate public-private partnerships.

      ### Sourcing new supply

      These organizations are working around the clock to produce new sources of equipment. Groups of entrepreneurs in technology, healthcare and logistics are securing overseas and domestic production and shipment of all types of PPE supplies. Others are contributing to production through efforts as varied as sewing and 3-D printing.

      ### Connecting need to supply

      These organizations are acting as clearinghouses for medical equipment by tracking urgent needs and matching buyers to suppliers to ensure that PPE gets to where it is needed most. They’ve taken in thousands of institutional requests so far and started making matches with suppliers.

      - org_name: Helena.org
      - org_name: Help Feed the Frontline
      - org_name: First Responders First Fund

      ### Providing data

      These organizations are providing accurate, timely information to help everyone protect themselves and others. This includes local and national infection data, guidelines for how to stop the spread and reduce the burden on the health care system, understanding social distancing, proper use of protective equipment and more.

outro: The coalition is an open, constantly growing organization. Each of our
  members contributes a different set of skills, knowledge and learned
  experience. Together, we share a fundamental commitment to building something
  greater than the sum of these crucial parts.
