        <h2>The Need</h2>
        <p>
          As hospitals struggle to find safe and reliable supplies, thousands of companies, organizations, and
          individuals are stepping up to get health care workers the personal protective equipment and lifesaving
          medical devices they need. But no single organization can do this alone. In fact, the proliferation of
          organizations in this space has made it incredibly challenging to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          National PPE Coalition is working on connecting everybody - state governments, corporations, manufacturers,
          non profits, and individuals - to help them create a new supply chain in real time. We’re doing that by
          sending real time updates about what everybody is doing, connecting members to each other, and directing
          people in need to organizations that can help.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-12 my-2">
        <h2>The Coalition</h2>
        <p>
          Our members are working on every part of the PPE problem - supply, demand, data tracking, logistics, fulfillment, funding, and more. From single individuals raising donations or sewing masks to multinational corporations producing badly needed ventilators and respirators, everybody plays a part. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The coalition is an open organization, and our goal is to get everybody working on these critical initiatives listed here in order to encourage communication and coordination.

        </p>

        <h3>Connecting need to supply</h3>
        <p>
          As hospitals struggle to find safe and reliable equipment, several organizations have come together to shake
          up the supply chain, improve logistics, and help save lives. Several coalition members are acting as
          clearinghouses for medical equipment by matching buyers to suppliers, tracking urgent needs and helping with
          logistics to ensure that PPE gets to where it is needed most. They’ve taken in thousands of institution
          requests so far and started making matches with suppliers.
        </p>

        <div class="col-10 my-2">
          <h4>Project N95</h4>
          <p>Project N95 is focused on delivering medical equipment into the hands of healthcare providers as quickly as
            possibly by serving as the nation's medical clearinghouse for hospital and healthcare requests and suppliers
            who are able to provide medical equipment, including ventilators. They’re working with FEMA, governments,
            and hospitals and healthcare networks to determine where demand is and where it is most urgent.</p>

          <h4>GetUsPPE</h4>
          <p>Get Us PPE is a national, centralized platform that leverages a large network of partners and volunteers
            to: facilitate safe and efficient delivery of supplies to local hospitals, advocate for immediate action to
            expedite the manufacture of medical PPE nationwide and unite the maker community to validate and share PPE
            designs that can be printed and assembled locally. It is a collaboration between physicians and medical
            researchers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic, engineers, scientists and programmers.</p>

          <h4>PPE Link</h4>
          <p>PPE Link is working to collect and connect donations of standard PPE (not homemade) from local communities
            of academic and industry STEM labs as well as any other institutions or companies that use PPE in their
            operations to help provide a short-term stopgap by donating their local hospitals with supplies until
            national efforts are able to compensate.</p>

          <h4>Masks For Docs</h4>
          <p>Masks for Docs is focused exclusively on providing protective masks to health care workers. They are
            collecting masks and have volunteers making and printing masks, and are building a resource to match
            supplies with hospitals in need and distribute them.</p>

          <h4>Operation Masks</h4>
          <p>Operation Masks has partnered with logistics experts to get masks, gloves and other PPE from payment to
            factory procurement to shipping to ground delivery to hospitals.</p>

          <h4>Help Hospitals</h4>
          <p>Help Hospitals is working to catalog hospitals and their supply needs in order to connect with the
            appropriate donations of PPE.</p>

          <h4>Harbor Freight</h4>
          <p>Harbor Freight is shipping more than 44 million pairs of nitrile gloves and hundreds of thousands of masks
            and face shields to hospitals in over 1,000 communities that requested them directly. </p>

          <h4>So You Want To Help with PPE</h4>
          <p>A list of resources for helping with the shortage of PPE, including places to donate and volunteer, plans
            and specs for sewing, 3D printing and donating masks, ways to request masks and face shields, answers to
            frequently asked questions about making masks and other ways to help both regionally and nationally</p>

          <h4>Find the Masks</h4>
          <p>Find the Masks has catalogued nationwide donation locations for PPE including surgical mask & N95 Masks,
            face shields, medical booties, safety goggles, gloves, kleenex, hand sanitizer, medical overalls, gowns, and
            advanced respirators (PAPR/CAPR/etc.). Filter by location or type of PPE.</p>

          <h4>Mask Match</h4>
          <p>Mask Match is a peer-to-peer matching site for direct shipping between those who have masks to donate and
            those who are in need.</p>

          <h4>Get Them PPE</h4>
          <p>Get Them PEE is a crowdsourcing site built to help identify hospitals and other organizations that are
            severely undersupplied and in need of donations. Use the map to find out what items local hospitals are in
            need of and get contact info for each hospital to coordinate donations. There is also a separate form to
            submit hospital needs for inclusion. </p>

          <h4>Worldwide Supply Chain Federation</h4>
          <p>The Worldwide Supply Chain Federation is using its collective resources as a grassroots supply chain to
            source the most critical materials. It’s working with a number of government and private organizations to
            get everything where it is most needed, and to minimize random inquiries these groups need to vet and screen
            through.</p>

          <h4>Mask Brigade</h4>
          <p>The goal of each Mask Brigade’s is to help local residents and small businesses donate their N95 masks to
            the local healthcare community. Volunteers will pick up donated N95 masks as well as any other PPE and take
            them to local hospitals. They also offer information on methods for direct donation.</p>
        </div>



        <h3 class="my-4">Sourcing new supply</h3>
        <p>
          Demand is surging, and supply chains aren’t able to keep up. To fill the gap, these coalition members are
          working around the clock to produce new sources of equipment. Groups of entrepreneurs in technology,
          healthcare and logistics are securing overseas and domestic production and shipment of all types of PPE
          supplies. Other coalition members are helping fund domestic production and even 3-D printing badly needed
          equipment and parts.

          <h4>Massachusetts Life Sciences Emergency Supply Hub</h4>
          <p>Massachusetts Life Sciences Emergency Supply Hub is helping coordinate efforts to bring additional supplies
            and resources to Massachusetts healthcare institutions. They’re asking life sciences and healthcare
            organizations to consider how they may be able to help, specifically by donating lab, testing, and
            diagnostics supplies, personal protection equipment (PPE), and medical and scientific expertise needed to
            combat COVID-19.</p>

          <h4>Massachusetts COVID-19 Manufacturing Capacity Index</h4>
          <p>As part of a coordinated response between academic, industry, and government, the Massachusetts COVID-19
            Manufacturing Capacity Index team is indexing the Commonwealth's manufacturing capacity to produce
            critically-needed components. Organizations NOT located within the State of MA can also complete the form,
            and the information will be used for coordinating efforts between other state and federal initiatives.</p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="my-4">Paying for everything</h3>
        <p>Foundations and nonprofits are stepping up to get healthcare workers the equipment they need to fight
          COVID-19 by floating capital and raising funds from individual donors. Several coalition members are raising
          significant sums to purchase large supplies of PPE and distribute them to hospital systems that are most in
          need. Some of our individual members are running GoFundMe campaigns to aggregate small donors and make a big
          difference.

        <h3 class="my-4">Providing data</h3>
        <p>In a public health emergency like this, people need accurate information to protect themselves and their
          families. Coalition members are helping you stay safe by slowing the spread of the virus and misinformation at
          the same time. These groups are doing everything from providing guidelines for reducing the burden on the
          health care system to helping folks understand social distancing to showing individuals the proper uses of
          protective equipment.</p>
