        <p>
          National PPE Coalition brings crucial partners together to help build an efficient, unified supply chain for
          PPE and lifesaving medical devices. State governments, corporations, manufacturers, non-profits, and
          individuals can connect through us to share and request resources and information.
        </p>
        <p>Our members are working on every part of the problem: supply, demand, fulfillment, logistics, funding, and
          information tracking. We use real-time updates about what every organization is doing in order to maximize
          efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
        <p>
          By coordinating all emergency PPE crisis efforts, we help minimize the risk of misdirecting critical supplies
          to places that may need them less urgently, and increase their individual power exponentially. We’re working
          together to ensure that every shipment of PPE sent is a life-saving shipment.

        <h3>Connecting need to supply</h3>
        <p>
          As hospitals struggle to find safe and reliable equipment, several organizations have come together to shake
          up the supply chain, improve logistics, and help save lives. Several coalition members are acting as
          clearinghouses for medical equipment by matching buyers to suppliers, tracking urgent needs and helping with
          logistics to ensure that PPE gets to where it is needed most. They’ve taken in thousands of institutional
          requests so far and started making matches with suppliers.

            who are able to provide medical equipment, including ventilators. They’re working with FEMA, governments,
