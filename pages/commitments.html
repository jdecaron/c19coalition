  # Announcing C19 Coalition Partner Commitments


  ## Calling for others to join our effort to double PPE Production


  **April 29, 2020**


  To get PPE to those who need it most, more than 20 organizations, companies, and philanthropists have joined forces to establish the C19 Coalition. Together, we’re leveraging our collective assets to combat the medical supply shortage, in partnership with state governments. 


  Our partners, listed below, are making commitments to bring their resources to address three key needs:


  1. Increasing supply of medical-grade PPE, through both domestic production and international supply chains 

  2. Enabling more accessible PPE procurement with a $30+ million non-profit Bridge Financing Fund 

  3. Sharing data and intelligence to allow PPE supply chains to respond to demand


  ## Make a Commitment to Action


  To scale up its impact, the C19 Coalition is asking more leaders to join in making commitments to action. The C19 Coalition’s initial goal is to double its current level of net new PPE production and distribution. The C19 Coalition is actively seeking partnership and commitments to action from other organizations that are working to address medical supply shortage, including: 


  * **States and localities** interested in sharing information about demand needs, including specific facilities that need access to working capital to de-risk PPE purchases. 

  * **Domestic manufacturers** that are producing, or want to repurpose and retool to produce, net new PPE.

  * **Philanthropists and institutional investors** who are interested in providing philanthropic zero interest loans or low interest working capital loans to purchase PPE.


  [If you are an organization interested in bringing your efforts into the C19 Coalition, fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSePSBl9BC7SoN0PMXNkON2gnZzV8gFEwoGQNhWuyCx-n7m-Uw/viewform).


  ## C19 Coalition Partner Commitments


  ### 1. Increasing supply of medical-grade PPE through both domestic production and international supply chains


  The C19 Coalition is bringing together members with industry expertise to increase net new supply of PPE materials. We are coordinating support for materials and build specifications, technical and engineering support, FDA approvals and testing, connecting supply to demand, & distribution logistics.


  While many U.S. companies have already started to repurpose production facilities for medical supplies, efforts have often been independently designed, funded, and managed. Many manufacturers have expressed major challenges rising from a lack of standardized specifications and coordinated support, as well as shortages of raw materials.

  * **U.S. manufacturing associations** can help through driving and coordinating efforts.

  * **Medical distributors** can help through sharing technical specifications for materials in shortage, and shortening their intake processes to onboard new suppliers into their supply chains.

  * **Logistics providers** can coordinate with net new manufacturing to help get raw materials where they are needed, and speed finished product to the providers and areas in greatest need.
